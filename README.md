# Graph-Neural-Network (GNN)
Many underlying relationships among data in several areas of science and engineering, e.g., computer vision, molecular chemistry, molecular biology, pattern recognition, and data mining, can be represented in terms of graphs. a new neural network model has proposed, which called graph neural network (GNN)
