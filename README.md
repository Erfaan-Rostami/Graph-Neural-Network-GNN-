# Graph-Neural-Network\(GNN\)
Many underlying relationships among data in several areas of science and engineering, e.g., computer vision, molecular chemistry, molecular biology, pattern recognition, and data mining, can be represented in terms of graphs. In this paper ,a new neural network model has propose which called graph neural network (GNN)
